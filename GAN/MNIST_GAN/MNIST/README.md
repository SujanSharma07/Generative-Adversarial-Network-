# Generative-Adversarial-Network-

Tried to implement Generative Adversarial Network on MNIST dataset as shown in the medium article: https://medium.com/ai-society/gans-from-scratch-1-a-deep-introduction-with-code-in-pytorch-and-tensorflow-cb03cdcdba0f . 

Did some parameter tuning just to observe the changes in results. 

Results are shown till 67 epochs out of 200.
